Welcome to **Zagreb Old Town** — a walkable blend of medieval streets, colorful roofs, open-air markets, and lived-in city squares. Start early, take it slow, and let the city’s everyday rhythm guide you.

### Upper Town: St. Mark’s & stories in the stones

The heart of the Upper Town is **St. Mark’s Square** with its unmistakable mosaic-roof church. Gothic, intimate, and instantly photogenic, it anchors a neighborhood of narrow lanes, hidden courtyards, and viewpoints where the skyline opens toward the Cathedral.

From here, you’re minutes away from **Stone Gate (Kamenita vrata)**, the 13th-century passage that survived a great fire — locals still stop to light a candle inside the small shrine. This entire area rewards slow steps and curious detours.

### Market life: steps to Dolac

Follow the flow downhill toward **Dolac Market** — Zagreb’s classic farmers’ market, where red umbrellas dot the square and vendors sell fruit, cheese, and fresh produce from villages around the city. Approaching from the **Dolac steps** is a small ritual: you hear the chatter before you see the stalls.

If you’re here on a **Sunday**, circle to **Britanski trg** for the antique fair, or go very early to **Jakuševec** for a full-on flea market (best before noon).

### The grand axis: Tomislav Square & Art Pavilion

A few minutes’ walk from the Old Town ridge, the city opens into grand 19th-century parks. On **King Tomislav Square**, the **Art Pavilion** glows warm yellow — a perfect spot to rest your feet.
